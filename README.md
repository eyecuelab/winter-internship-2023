## üìù Summary <a id="summary"></a>

_This is a full-stack application that uses Prisma/PostgreSQL for the database, Node.js/Express for the server, and React for the front-end. It is written in Typescript and utilizes Socket.io for real-time game play with mutliple players from different computers._

## ‚úÖ Description <a id="description"></a>

#### General Instructions:
_Get ready for an exciting gaming experience with our web application inspired by Pac-Man and Mario Kart! This multiplayer game allows a group of up to 8 users to control Pac-Man and Ghost 'PaCarts', with each PaCart controlled by two players. One teammate controls up and down using the "W" and "S" keys, while the other controls left and right using "A" and "D" keys. Control of the PaCart switches between teammates after each move, requiring strategic planning and seamless coordination.

If you are a Pac-Man, your objective is to collect all pellets scattered across the map. But be warned! If you're a Ghost, your goal is to take down the Pac-Man. When a Ghost catches a Pac-Man, the Ghost transforms into a Pac-Man and begins collecting pellets. The captured Pac-Man becomes a Ghost and must try to catch a Pac-Man.

However, Ghosts do not collect pellets but receive points for catching a Pac-Man. The game continues until all pellets on the map have been collected, and the team with the highest score at the end is declared the winner!

Are you ready to take on the challenge and compete against your friends in this fast-paced multiplayer game? Join us and experience the thrill of the race as you maneuver through the map and outsmart your opponents!_

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation, Setup, and Running The App <a id="installation-setup-and-running-the-app"></a>

### Setup/Installation Requirements <a id="installation"></a>

- _Please ensure you have the latest version of NodeJs and PostgreSQL_
- _Clone this repository <https://github.com/eyecuelab/winter-internship-2023/tree/main> locally_
- _Navigate to the root folder `winter-internship-2023` and then `cd server` and run `npm install` and then `cd client` and run `npm install`_.
- See below for required .env files
- You will also need to have your database setup in PostgreSQL
- To ensure the prisma schema has been updated to PostgreSQL, run a migration to create your database tables with Prisma Migrate:
  - `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`
- Also, Prisma Studio is a visual editor for the data in your database.
  - Run `npx prisma studio` in your terminal.

### Database Seeding <a id="database-seeding"></a>
- Using _[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)_, make a post request to http://localhost:3000/seed to seed the database with default data. 

### Required .env Files <a id="required-files"></a>

- In the `/server` directory, create an .env file and insert the following: `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:yourPasswordGoesHere@localhost:5432/yourDatabaseNameGoesHere?schema=yourSchemaNameGoesHere"`
- Then save

### Running the App Locally <a id="running-the-app-locally"></a>

- Split your terminal into two separate consoles
- Navigate one terminal into the `/server` directory and run `npm start`
- Navigate the second terminal into the `/client` directory and run `npm run dev`. If your browser does not automatically load, type `http://localhost:3000/` manually in the browser
- For locally testing this particular game, you will need to open 2 browser windows to have 2 unique users enter the game, as the game will not run or be playable until at least 2 people have entered.
