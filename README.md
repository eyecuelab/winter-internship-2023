## üìù Summary <a id="summary"></a>

_This is a full stack application that uses prisma and postgresql for the backend, node/express for the server, and react for the front-end and is written using typescript._

## ‚úÖ Description <a id="description"></a>

_This is a web application that will allow a group of users to play a PacMan/Mario Cart inspired game. The objective of the game is for PacMan controlled carts is to collect all pellets on the map. If you are playing as a Ghost on spawn, your objective is to take down the PacMan cart. When a Ghost catches a PacMan, The Ghost then becomes a PacMan cart allowing them to start collecting pellets. The caught PacMan now becomes a ghost and has to try and get it's body back. The game ends when all of the pellets on the map have been collected.._

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation, Setup, and Running The App <a id="installation-setup-and-running-the-app"></a>

### Setup/Installation Requirements <a id="installation"></a>

- _Please ensure you have the latest version of NodeJs and PostgreSQL_
- _Clone this repository <https://github.com/eyecuelab/winter-internship-2023/tree/main> locally_
- _Navigate to the root folder `winter-internship-2023` and then `cd server` and run `npm install` and then `cd client` and run `npm install`_.
- See below for required .env files
- You will also need to have your database setup in PostgreSQL
- To ensure the prisma schema has been updated to PostgreSQL, Run a migration to create your database tables with Prisma Migrate:
  - `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`
  - `npm run seed` to seed the database with the default roles
- Also, Prisma Studio is a visual editor for the data in your database.
  - Run `npx prisma studio` in your terminal.

### Required .env Files <a id="required-files"></a>

- In the `/server` directory, create an .env file and insert the following: `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:yourPasswordGoesHere@localhost:5432/yourDatabaseNameGoesHere?schema=yourSchemaNameGoesHere"` & `SESSION_SECRET="yourSecretGoesHere"`
- Then save
- In the `/client` directory, create an .env file (separate from the previous), and insert the following: `VITE_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000`
- Then save

### Running the App Locally <a id="running-the-app-locally"></a>

- Split your terminal into two separate consoles
- Navigate one terminal into the `/server` directory and run `npm start`
- Navigate the second terminal into the `/client` directory and run `npm run dev` as well. If your browser does not automatically load, type `http://localhost:3000/` manually in the browser
